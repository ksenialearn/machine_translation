# Training the Model
# ------------------

# To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
# of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
# the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
# encoder as its first hidden state.

# **"Teacher Forcing"**, or maximum likelihood sampling, means using the real target outputs as each next input when training. The alternative is using the decoder's own guess as the next input. Using teacher forcing may cause the network to converge faster, but when the trained network is exploited, it may exhibit instability.

# You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation - you could think of it as having learned how to listen to the teacher's instructions, without learning how to venture out on its own.

# The solution to the teacher-forcing "problem" is known as [Scheduled Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099), which simply alternates between using the target values and predicted values when training. We will randomly choose to use teacher forcing with an if statement while training - sometimes we'll feed use real target as the input (ignoring the decoder's output), sometimes we'll use the decoder's output.


# Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
# choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
# ``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.
